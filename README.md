## Overview of Analysis

The Pyber Challenge requires us to write and execute code for the following two deliverables: 1) using the Pandas groupby() function with the count() and sum() methods on PyBer DataFrame columns, get the total number of rides, total number of drivers, and the total fares for each city type and 2) using our Pandas skills and two new functions, pivot() and resample(), create a multiple-line graph that shows the total fares for each week by city type. Subsequently, I delivered a written analysis below with a rideshare dataframe by city type and the results in differences in costs between urban, suburban and rural rides. Additionally, the written analysis provides three recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
